# Project Title

Project Name - nestHub
Project Description - This application is a schedular for bizzNEST to pair people from different departments and locations. 

# Project Requirements
This project is focused on building a Randomized Scheduling Application using frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The application will allow users to group and pair interns from different locations and departments based on customizable rules. Key features include:

- Intern Data Management: Storing and displaying intern data from a static JSON object.
- Randomized Scheduling: Automatically generating schedules based on configurable rules, such as pairing interns from different cities or departments.
- Selection and Filtering: Users can include/exclude interns and apply filters.
- Rule Configuration: Customize pairing rules and add new ones.
- Manual Overrides: Adjust schedules manually if needed.
- Edge Case Handling: Handling uneven numbers and conflicting criteria.
- Responsive UI: A clean, accessible interface for desktop and mobile.
- GitHub Integration: Follows structured commit and coding practices.

The application is entirely frontend-based, requiring no backend, and is optimized for lightweight, fast performance.
